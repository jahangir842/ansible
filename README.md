# Ansible Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Ansible Practice Repository**!  
This repository is intended for hands-on learning, testing, and practicing Ansible concepts, modules, playbooks, and automation techniques.

---

## 📌 Objective

The main goals of this repo are:
- Practice using Ansible core modules (`ansible.builtin.*`)
- Learn how to manage inventory, write playbooks, use roles, and handle secrets with Vault
- Experiment with Ansible configuration, command-line usage, and Galaxy collections

## ✅ Example Practice Topics

Here are some of the topics I plan to cover or have covered in this repo:

* Using `ansible.builtin.ping`, `ansible.builtin.copy`, `ansible.builtin.command`, etc.
* Managing static and dynamic inventory files
* Writing idempotent playbooks
* Encrypting variables using Ansible Vault
* Using tags, handlers, and conditionals
* Creating and using Ansible roles
* Using `ansible-galaxy` to install and use community roles

## 📎 Notes

This is an evolving practice project. As I learn more, I’ll add:

* More examples and playbooks
* Real-world use cases
* Role-based deployments
* Cloud provisioning tasks
