# Getting Started with Ansible

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies IT configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. It operates agentlessly over SSH and does not require any additional software installation on the target nodes.

---

## Key Concepts in Ansible

### 1. **Control Node**
- The machine where Ansible is installed and from which tasks are executed.
- Requires Python 3.x installed.
- Runs Ansible commands, playbooks, and modules.

### 2. **Managed Nodes**
- The remote servers or devices managed by the Ansible control node.
- Communicated via SSH (or WinRM for Windows).
- No agent or software installation is required on the managed nodes.

## Ansible Installation

### On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible -y
```

### On RHEL/CentOS:
Enable EPEL repository:
```bash
sudo yum install epel-release -y
```
Install Ansible:
```bash
sudo yum install ansible -y
```

### Verifying Installation:
```bash
ansible --version
```

## Ansible Inventory

An inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts that Ansible manages. 

### Example: `/etc/ansible/hosts`
```ini
[webservers]
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.11

[dbservers]
192.168.1.20 ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/key
```

- **Groups**: `[webservers]`, `[dbservers]`
- **Variables**: `ansible_user`, `ansible_ssh_private_key_file`

---

## Ansible Configuration

The primary configuration file is `ansible.cfg`. It can be located:
- `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`
- Current working directory (`./ansible.cfg`)

### Key Settings:
```ini
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
remote_user = ubuntu
private_key_file = /path/to/private_key
host_key_checking = False
```

---

## Ad-Hoc Commands

Ansible allows executing single commands without writing a playbook.

### Ping All Hosts:
```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

### Execute Shell Commands:
```bash
ansible webservers -a "uptime"
```

### Install a Package:
```bash
ansible dbservers -m apt -a "name=nginx state=present"
```

---

## Ansible Playbooks

Playbooks are YAML files used to define multiple tasks and configurations.

### Sample Playbook: `site.yml`
```yaml
---
- name: Configure webservers
  hosts: webservers
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start and enable Nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: true
```

### Run the Playbook:
```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml
```

---

## Modules

Ansible modules are the core tools for executing tasks.

### Commonly Used Modules:
- `ping`: Checks connectivity.
- `shell` / `command`: Executes commands on remote nodes.
- `apt` / `yum`: Manages packages.
- `copy`: Copies files to remote hosts.
- `service`: Manages system services.

### Example:
```bash
ansible webservers -m copy -a "src=/local/file dest=/remote/path"
```

---

## Types of Nodes in Ansible

### 1. **Control Node**
   - The master system where Ansible is installed.
   - Manages multiple managed nodes.

### 2. **Managed Node**
   - Any server, device, or system managed by Ansible.
   - Can be grouped logically for better organization.

## Best Practices for Ansible

1. **Organize Inventory**:
   - Group hosts logically in the inventory file.
   - Use variables to simplify tasks.

2. **Use Roles**:
   - Encapsulate playbooks, variables, templates, and tasks.
   - Example folder structure:
     ```
     roles/
       webserver/
         tasks/
         handlers/
         templates/
         vars/
         defaults/
     ```

3. **Secure Sensitive Data**:
   - Use `ansible-vault` to encrypt sensitive information.
     ```bash
     ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml
     ```

4. **Test Playbooks**:
   - Always test on a staging environment before deploying to production.

5. **Version Control**:
   - Store playbooks and configurations in Git for tracking and collaboration.

## Troubleshooting

### Debugging:
Use the `-vvv` flag for detailed output:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml -vvv
```

### Testing Connectivity:
```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

### Checking Syntax:
```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --syntax-check
```
